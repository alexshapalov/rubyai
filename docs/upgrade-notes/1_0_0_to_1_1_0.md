# Upgrading from 1.0.x to 1.1.0

This document contains only the changes comparing to v1.0.x releases. For the new features see the [release notes](../release_notes.md).

## Upgrade process

You can upgrade Ruby gems and Go server in any order.

## Rails/Ruby

### General

Ruby 2.6+ is required.

Rails 6.0+ is required.

Anyway Config 2.1+ is required.

### RPC middlewares API change

Middlewares are no longer inherited from gRPC interceptors.

That allowed us to have _real_ middlewares with ability to modify responses, intercept exceptions, etc.
The API changed a bit:

```diff
 class SomeMiddleware < AnyCable::Middleware
-  def call(request, rpc_call, rpc_handler)
+  def call(rpc_method_name, request, metadata)
     yield
   end
 end
```

See [built-in middlewares](https://github.com/anycable/anycable/tree/master/lib/anycable/middlewares), for example.

## `anycable-go`

### Configuration changes

Renamed `metrics_log_interval` to `metrics_rotate_interval`.
The older name is deprecated and will be removed in the next major/minor release.
