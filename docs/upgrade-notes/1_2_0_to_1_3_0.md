# Upgrading from 1.1.x/1.2.x to 1.3.0

This document contains only the changes comparing to v1.1.x releases. For the new features see the [release notes](../release_notes.md).

## Upgrade process

You can upgrade Ruby gems and Go server in any order.

## Rails/Ruby

### Max connection age for RPC

AnyCable now sets the max connection age for gRPC connections to 5 minutes by default. It's important to re-validate gRPC connections in case of DNS-based load balancing to react on formation changes (e.g., adding new RPC servers).

If you set `ANYCABLE_RPC_SERVER_ARGS__MAX_CONNECTION_AGE_MS` (or `rpc_server_args.max_connection_age_ms`) to 300000 (5 minutes), you can remove this setting. If you used a different value for max connection age, you can provide it via the new configuration parameterâ€”`rpc_max_connection_age` (or `ANYCABLE_RPC_MAX_CONNECTION_AGE`). **NOTE:** The new parameter accepts seconds, not milliseconds.

### Rails 7 reporter integration

The `anycable-rails` library now integrates with Rails 7+ error reporter interface automatically (since v1.3.6). If your error reporting software supports Rails built-in error reporting (e.g., Sentry does), you no longer need to configure `AnyCable.capture_exception { ... }` yourself.
