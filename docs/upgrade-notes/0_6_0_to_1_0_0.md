# Upgrading from 0.6.x to 1.0.0

This document contains only the changes comparing to v0.6.x releases. For the new features see the [release notes](../release_notes.md).

## Upgrade process

Since AnyCable-Go v1.0 is backward-compatible with Ruby gems of 0.6.x series,
we recommend the following upgrade process:

1. Upgrade AnyCable-Go.
1. Upgrade Ruby gems.

## Rails/Ruby

### General

Ruby 2.5+ is required.

AnyCable-Go 1.0+ is required.

### Default RPC server host changed

We used `[::]:50051` by default which could be harmful (see [#71](https://github.com/anycable/anycable/pull/71)).

Now AnyCable RPC uses a loopback interface as the default (`127.0.0.1:50051`).

### Session access hacks are not required anymore

Rails `session` object in Action Cable connection is supported out-of-the-box. No additional hacking is needed.

### Use AnyCable Rack middleware to support `env["warden"]`

For example, for Devise all you need is to add the following configuration:

```ruby
AnyCable::Rails::Rack.middleware.use Warden::Manager do |config|
  Devise.warden_config = config
end
```

See also [Authentication](../rails/authentication.md).

## `anycable-go`

### Default host changed

The default value for HTTP server host has changed from `0.0.0.0` to `localhost`.

If you want to continue using `0.0.0.0`, configure your server explicitly:

```sh
$ anycable-go --host=0.0.0.0

# or via env vars
$ ANYCABLE_HOST=0.0.0.0 anycable-go
```

### Docker images versioning

Docker images versioning changed from `vX.Y.Z` to `X.Y.Z`.
Now you can specify only the part of the version, e.g. `anycable-go:1.0` instead of the full `anycable-go:v1.0.0`.
