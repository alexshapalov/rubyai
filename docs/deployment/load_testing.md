> Read the ["Real-time stress: AnyCable, k6, WebSockets, and Yabeda"](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/real-time-stress-anycable-k6-websockets-and-yabeda) post to learn more about WebSockets load testing.

We maintain a [k6][] extension to load-test (or stress-test) Action Cable and AnyCable compatible WebSocket serversâ€”[xk6-cable][]. See the project's Readme for further instructions.
