## Memory usage

Pro version uses a different memory model under the hood, which gives you yet another **30-50% RAM usage reduction**.

Here is the results of running [websocket-bench][] `broadcast` and `connect` benchmarks and measuring RAM used:

| versionÂ | broadcast 5k | connect 10k |  connect 15k |
|---|----|---|---|
| 1.3.0-pro               |  142MB | 280MB | 351MB |
| 1.3.0-pro (w/o poll)\*  |  207MB | 343MB | 480MB |
| 1.3.0                   |  217MB | 430MB | 613MB |

\* AnyCable-Go Pro uses epoll/kqueue to react on incoming messages by default.
In most cases, that should work the same way as with non-Pro version; however, if you have a really high rate of
incoming messages, you might want to fallback to the _actor-per-connection_ model (you can do this by specifying `--netpoll_enabled=false`).

**NOTE:** Currently, using net polling is not compatible with WebSocket per-message compression (it's disabled even if you enabled it explicitly).
