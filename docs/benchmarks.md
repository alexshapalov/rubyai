# Benchmarks

> The latest benchmark results are available at [the main repo](https://github.com/anycable/anycable/blob/master/benchmarks/2020-06-30.md).

**NOTE:** We run Action Cable with **eight** Puma workers. Using lower number of processes results in a much higher latency during broadcasting as well as connection timeout errors.

## Broadcasting RTT

Broadcasting round-trip time benchmark (based on [Hashrocket's bench](https://github.com/hashrocket/websocket-shootout)) measures how much time does it take for the server to re-transmit the message to all the connected clientsâ€“the less the time, the better the _real-time-ness_ of the server.

The results of this benchmark could be seen below.

## Memory usage

Memory usage of AnyCable is significantly lower than of Action Cable.

That's achieved by moving memory-intensive operations into (storing connection states and subscriptions maps, serializing data into a standalone WebSocket server.
