## `Failed to connect to Redis: unknown command 'CLIENT', with args beginning with: 'TRACKING'`

Some managed Redis (e.g., Google Cloud) providers block many Redis commands, including [client-side server tracking](https://redis.io/commands/client-tracking/), which is enabled in AnyCable by default. If you experience this issue, set the `--redis_disable_cache` flag (or `ANYCABLE_REDIS_DISABLE_CACHE=true`).

## `ActionCable.server.broadcast` doesn't send messages

The most common problem is using different Redis channels within RPC instance and `anycable-go`. Find the following line in the logs:

```sh
# for AnyCable-Go
$ anycable-go
...
INFO time context=pubsub Subscribed to Redis channel: __anycable__

# for RPC
$ bundle exec anycable
...
I, [2019-03-06T10:08:03.915310 #7922]  INFO -- : Broadcasting Redis channel: __anycable__
```

Make sure that both servers use the same Redis channel (`__anycable__` in the example above).

## Server raises an `NotImplementedError: nil` exception when client tries to connect

If you encounter an exception like this:

```sh
There was an exception - NotImplementedError(NotImplementedError)
  .../gems/actioncable-7.0.4/lib/action_cable/subscription_adapter/base.rb:22:in `unsubscribe':in
  ...
```

that means you're client tries to connect to the built-in Action Cable server, and not the AnyCable one.

Check that:

- `config.action_cable.url` points to the AnyCable server and not to the Rails one
- make sure your client is configured to connect to AnyCable server
- drop `mount ActionCable.server => "/cable"` from your `routes.rb`
- in case of using a reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx), check that it points to the correct server as well.

## Authentication fails with `undefined method 'protocol' for nil:NilClass`

That could happen if there is a monkey-patch overriding the default Action Cable behaviour. For example, `lograge` [does this](https://github.com/roidrage/lograge/pull/257#issuecomment-525690256) (at least versions <= 0.11.2).

## My WebSocket connection fails with "Auth failed" error

It's likely that you're using cookie-based authentication. There are several things that could break here.

1. Cross-domain cookies.

Make sure that your cookies are accessible from both domain (HTTP server and WebSocket server). For example:

```ruby
# session_store.rb
Rails.application.config.session_store :cookie_store,
  key: "_any_cable_session",
  domain: :all # or domain: '.example.com'

# anywhere setting cookie
cookies[:val] = {value: "1", domain: :all}
```

**NOTE**: It's impossible to set cookies for `.herokuapp.com`. [Read more](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cookies-and-herokuapp-com).

2. `SECRET_KEY_BASE` vs. encrypted cookies.

Make sure both RPC and web apps use the same `Rails.application.secret_key_base` (usually provided via credentials or `ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE']`).
If they don't match, cookies decryption would silently fail.

3. Middlewares configuration.

There could be a situation when AnyCable middleware chain behaves differently from Rails middleware chain.
Make sure you include only the necessary middlewares in the right order and with correct parameters.

Keep in mind that `anycable-rails` automatically includes the corresponding session store middleware in the beginning of the AnyCable chain, so you don't need to add it yourself.

## I see a lot of `too many open files` errors in the log

Congratulations! You have a lot (thousands) of simultaneous connections (and you hit the max open files limit).

For example, Heroku _standard_ dynos have a limit (both soft and hard) of 10000 open files, and _performance_ dynos have a limit of 1048576.

Does this mean that the theoretical limit of connections is 10k for standard dynos? Yes, but only theoretical.
But in practice, the process doesn't free open files (sockets in our case) immediately after disconnection; it waits for TCP close handshake to finish (and you can find such sockets in `CLOSE_WAIT` state).

So, if a lot of clients dropping connections, the actual limit on the number of active connections could be much less at the specific moment.

See the [OS tuning](anycable-go/os_tuning.md) guide for possible solutions.

## Problems with Docker alpine images

AnyCable ruby gem relies on [`google-protobuf`](https://rubygems.org/gems/google-protobuf) and [`grpc`](https://rubygems.org/gems/grpc) gems, which use native extensions.

That could bring some problems installing `anycable` on alpine Docker images due to the incompatibility
of the pre-built binaries.

Usually, building the gems from source:

```ruby
# use a gem from git
gem "google-protobuf", git: "https://github.com/google/protobuf"
```

Another option is to force Bundler to build native extensions during the installation:

```sh
BUNDLE_FORCE_RUBY_PLATFORM=1 bundle install
```

Or on per-gem basis using [this hack](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/21514#issuecomment-581417788).

See the [example Dockerfile](https://github.com/anycable/anycable/blob/master/etc/Dockerfile.alpine).

Another option to consider is switching to `grpc_kit` gem. See [documentation](./ruby/configuration.md#alternative-grpc-implementations) for more details.

## Client connection fails with `ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] "/cable")`

This exception means that your client attempts to connect to the Rails server not to AnyCable WebSocket server.

Check that:

- `config.action_cable.url` points to the AnyCable server and not to the Rails one.
- Make sure that `action_cable_meta_tag` is called before JS script is loaded.
- Make sure you do not pass incorrect URL to JS `createConsumer` question.
- In case of using a reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx), check that it points to the correct server as well.
